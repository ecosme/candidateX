Hi,


I had some issues with my computer last weekend, I reinstalled it and yesterday I started to code the application again to deliver this code today, unfortunately I didn't complete this tiny application on time nevertheless I'd like to plead to get more time to deliver it (if it's possible). 
I'd like to apologize for delivering this project with some outstanding components, such as complete the validation and the front end using AngularJS to provide proper parameters to the application.

For this application I used Java, Jersey, Hibernate, and the back end database used is MySQL.

Thanks and kind regards 
Edgar
